# wav_decode
- Given the audio file in WAV format, decode the binary data encoded in it.
- The data is encoded using Audio Frequency Shift-Keying (AFSK) in its simplest form
    - A single bit is the waveform between two zero-crossings
    - A one signal is a rectangle signal of t = 320 microseconds
    - A zero signal is a rectangle signal of t = 640 microseconds
    - The real-life data might no longer be an ideal rectangle, since it has undergone storage on physical media (e.g. a tape drive)
- The bit-stream that can be extracted from the decoded audio signal can be converted into bytes
    - The signal starts with a lead tone of roughly 2.5 seconds (all 1-bits, or 0xff bytes), and ends with an end block of about 0.5 seconds (all 1-bits).
    - 11 bits are used to encode a single byte â€“ 8 bits for the byte plus one start bit (valued 0) and two stop bits (valued 1)
    - The data is encoded with least-significant bit first
- The byte-stream has the following form:
    - The first two bytes are 0x42 and 0x03
    - After that, construct 64 messages of 30 bytes each, with the 31st byte being the checksum of the 30 bytes before that (need 1984 bytes = 64 * 31 for that)
    - The last byte before the end block is a 0x00 byte.
- The checksums will help to detect that your encoding works
- make, then run 'bin/main h' for help.
